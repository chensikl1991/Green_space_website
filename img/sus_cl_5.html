Urban residents desire equal access to economic prosperity, a clean environment, resources, and a healthy life. And yet, urban areas are often the sites of our deepest societal challenges: poverty, crime, discrimination, and unequal access to resources. Urban sustainability initiatives must recognize these concerns and actively address them. Understanding the diverse cultural practices in cities is critical to finding effective solutions.

Illinois Cures will address these concerns through community-focused projects, and by seeking to understand the systemic issues and dominant paradigms that influence infrastructure and service delivery.
