Citizens of urban areas desire the economic prosperity necessary to afford a high standard of living. Cities must provide sufficient opportunities for employment and wealth creation. However, prosperity need not be synonymous with continual growth. Instead, cities must find ways to create sustainable economic growth that does not damage the environment through pollution or poor land use planning. Cities with sustainable growth will be the most sought communities for job creation as well as urban development.
