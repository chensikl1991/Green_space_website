Cities seek to improve human health by focusing on medical and preventative care, but it is equally important to address the features and resources of the urban environment that impact health. People are healthier when they have strong social networks, which can be fostered through quality public spaces and services. Health is also impacted by people’s stress levels and physical activity, which in turn are shaped by transportation networks, crime levels, and access to nature and recreational spaces. Food security, the quality of food people consume, and environmental conditions, such as pollution and heat, all impact health.
