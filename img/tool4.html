A key goals is to establish an innovative framework to diagnose and tackle complex urban challenges through integrating analysis, measurement, and modeling with novel cyberGIS (geographic information science and systems (GIS) based on advanced cyberinfrastructure) and cyberinfrastructure (CI). Achieving these objectives above requires innovative synthesis among computer, computational, Earth and environmental, geographic, and social sciences as well as advanced cyberGIS, cloud computing, and urban sensing capabilities. The unique combination of these capabilities and related scientific expertise at the University of Illinois and its partners allows us to realize transformative scientific and engineering understanding for developing innovative solutions to many challenging environmental and urban problems.
