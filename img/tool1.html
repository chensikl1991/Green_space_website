The sustainable cities of the future utilizes a variety of technologies to make them ¡°smarter¡± through an increasingly effective combination of sensors and digital telecommunication networks. They make more efficient use of physical infrastructure and natural resources through artificial intelligence and data analytics that support strong and healthy economic, social, cultural development. These cities are inhabited by people whom are dedicated towards minimizing required inputs of energy, water, land and food; and better process management of the outputs of waste and pollution. Smart cities will engage effectively with local people and leaders through the use of open innovation processes and e-participation, improving the collective intelligence of the city's institutions through e-governance with emphasis placed on citizen participation and co-design. Cities of the future will have the ability to learn, adapt and innovate and thereby respond more effectively and promptly to changing circumstances.
